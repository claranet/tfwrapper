# claranet-tfwrapper

[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-release-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md) [![Mozilla Public License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mozilla-orange.svg)](LICENSE) [![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-pypi-green.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/claranet-tfwrapper/)

`tfwrapper` is a python wrapper for [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and legacy [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which aims to simplify their usage and enforce best practices.

Note: the term _Terraform_ is used in this documentation when talking about generic concepts like providers, modules, stacks and the HCL based domain specific language.

## Features

- OpenTofu and Terraform behaviour overriding
- State centralization enforcement
- Standardized file structure
- Stack initialization from templates
- AWS credentials caching
- Azure credentials loading (both Service Principal or User)
- GCP and GKE user ADC support
- Plugins caching
- Tab completion

## Setup Dependencies

- `python3` `>= 3.8.1 <4.0`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-venv`
- `pipx` (recommended)

## Runtime Dependencies

- `terraform` `>= 0.10` (`>= 0.15` for fully working Azure backend with isolation due to https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25416)
- `azure-cli` when using context based Azure authentication

## Recommended setup

- OpenTofu 1.6+ (recommended) or Terraform 1.0+ (warning: versions above 1.6 are not open-source, and may cause legal issues depending on the context you are using it).
- An AWS S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state centralization in AWS.
- An Azure Blob Storage container for state centralization in Azure.

## Installation

tfwrapper should installed using pipx (recommended) or pip:

```bash
pipx install claranet-tfwrapper
```

## Setup command-line completion

Add the following to your shell's interactive configuration file, e.g. `.bashrc` for bash:

```bash
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete tfwrapper -e tfwrapper)"
```

You can then press the completion key (usually `Tab â†¹`) twice to get your partially typed `tfwrapper` commands completed.

Note: the `-e tfwrapper` parameter adds an suffix to the defined `_python_argcomplete` function to avoid clashes with other packages (see https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete/issues/310#issuecomment-697168326 for context).

## Upgrade from tfwrapper v7 or older

If you used versions of the wrapper older than v8, there is not much to do when upgrading to v8
except a little cleanup.
Indeed, the wrapper is no longer installed as a git submodule of your project like it used to be instructed and there is no longer any `Makefile` to activate it.

Just clean up each project by destroying the `.wrapper` submodule:

```bash
git rm -f Makefile
git submodule deinit .wrapper
rm -rf .git/modules/.wrapper
git rm -f .wrapper
```

Then check the staged changes and commit them.

### Required files

tfwrapper expects multiple files and directories at the root of a project.

#### conf

Stacks configurations are stored in the `conf` directory.

#### templates

The `templates` directory is used to store the state backend configuration template and the Terraform stack templates used to initialize new stacks. Using a git submodule is recommended.

The following files are required:

- `templates/{provider}/common/state.tf.jinja2`: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage state backend configuration template.
- `templates/{provider}/basic/main.tf`: the default Terraform configuration for new stacks. The whole `template/{provider}/basic` directory is copied on stack initialization.

For example with AWS:

```bash
mkdir -p templates/aws/common templates/aws/basic

# create state configuration template with AWS backend
cat << 'EOF' > templates/aws/common/state.tf.jinja2
{% if region is not none %}
{% set region = '/' + region + '/' %}
{% else %}
{% set region = '/' %}
{% endif %}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-centralized-terraform-states-bucket"
    key    = "{{ client_name }}/{{ account }}/{{ environment }}{{ region }}{{ stack }}/terraform.state"
    region = "eu-west-1"

    dynamodb_table = "my-terraform-states-lock-table"
  }
}

resource "null_resource" "state-test" {}
EOF

# create a default stack templates with support for AWS assume role
cat << 'EOF' > templates/aws/basic/main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region     = var.aws_region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
  token      = var.aws_token
}
EOF
```

For example with Azure:

```bash
mkdir -p templates/azure/common templates/azure/basic

# create state configuration template with Azure backend
cat << 'EOF' > templates/azure/common/state.tf.jinja2
{% if region is not none %}
{% set region = '/' + region + '/' %}
{% else %}
{% set region = '/' %}
{% endif %}

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    subscription_id      = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    resource_group_name  = "my-resource-group"
    storage_account_name = "my-centralized-terraform-states-account"
    container_name       = "terraform-states"

    key = "{{ client_name }}/{{ account }}/{{ environment }}{{ region }}{{ stack }}/terraform.state"
  }
}
EOF

# create a default stack templates with support for Azure credentials
cat << 'EOF' > templates/azure/basic/main.tf
provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = var.azure_subscription_id
  tenant_id       = var.azure_tenant_id
}
EOF
```

#### .run

The `.run` directory is used for credentials caching and plan storage.

```bash
mkdir .run
cat << 'EOF' > .run/.gitignore
*
!.gitignore
EOF
```

#### .gitignore

Adding the following `.gitignore` at the root of your project is recommended:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > .gitignore
.terraform
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup
terraform.tfvars
EOF
```

## Configuration

tfwrapper uses yaml files stored in the `conf` directory of the project.

### tfwrapper configuration

tfwrapper uses some default behaviors that can be overridden or modified via a `config.yml` file in the `conf` directory.

```yaml
---
always_trigger_init: False # Always trigger `terraform init` first when launching `plan` or `apply` commands
pipe_plan_command: "cat" # Default command used when you're invoking tfwrapper with `--pipe-plan`
use_local_azure_session_directory: False # Use the current user's Azure configuration in `~/.azure`. By default, the wrapper uses a local `azure-cli` session and configuration in the local `.run` directory.
```

### Stacks configurations

Stacks configuration files use the following naming convention:

```bash
conf/${account}_${environment}_${region}_${stack}.yml
```

Here is an example for an AWS stack configuration:

```yaml
---
state_configuration_name: "aws" # use "aws" backend state configuration
aws:
  general:
    account: &aws_account "xxxxxxxxxxx" # aws account for this stack
    region: &aws_region eu-west-1 # aws region for this stack
  credentials:
    profile: my-aws-profile # should be configured in .aws/config

terraform:
  legacy: false # Use legacy version of the tool instead of OpenTofu, defaults to false. Only used if version >= 1.6.0.
  version: "1.0" # OpenTofu version that tfwrapper will use for this stack. Automatically downloaded if it's not available locally. Defaults to 1.0
  vars: # variables passed to terraform
    aws_account: *aws_account
    aws_region: *aws_region
    client_name: my-client-name # arbitrary client name
```

Here is an example for a stack on Azure configuration using user mode and AWS S3 backend for state storage:

```yaml
---
state_configuration_name: "aws-demo" # use "aws" backend state configuration
azure:
  general:
    mode: user # Uses personal credentials with MFA
    directory_id: &directory_id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Azure Tenant/Directory UID
    subscription_id: &subscription_id "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" # Azure Subscription UID

terraform:
  legacy: false # Use legacy version of the tool instead of OpenTofu, defaults to false. Only used if version >= 1.6.0.
  version: "1.0" # OpenTofu version that tfwrapper will use for this stack. Automatically downloaded if it's not available locally. Defaults to 1.0
  vars:
    subscription_id: *subscription_id
    directory_id: *directory_id
    client_name: client-name #Replace it with the name of your client
```

It is using your account linked to a Microsoft Account. You must have access to the Azure Subscription if you want to use Terraform.

Here is an example for a stack on Azure configuration using Service Principal mode:

```yaml
---
azure:
  general:
    mode: service_principal # Uses an Azure tenant Service Principal account
    directory_id: &directory_id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Azure Tenant/Directory UID
    subscription_id: &subscription_id "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" # Azure Subscription UID

    credentials:
      profile: customer-profile # To stay coherent, create an AzureRM profile with the same name as the account-alias. Please checkout `azurerm_config.yml.sample` file for configuration structure.

terraform:
  legacy: false # Use legacy version of the tool instead of OpenTofu, defaults to false. Only used if version >= 1.6.0.
  version: "1.0" # OpenTofu version that tfwrapper will use for this stack. Automatically downloaded if it's not available locally. Defaults to 1.0
  vars:
    subscription_id: *subscription_id
    directory_id: *directory_id
    client_name: client-name # Replace it with the name of your client
```

The wrapper uses the Service Principal's credentials to connect the Azure subscription. The given Service Principal must have access to the subscription.
The wrapper loads `client_id`, `client_secret` and `tenant_id` properties from your `config.yml` file located in `~/.azurerm/config.yml`.

`~/.azurerm/config.yml` file structure example:

```yaml
---
claranet-sandbox:
  client_id: aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-zzzzzzzzzzzz
  client_secret: AAbbbCCCzzz==
  tenant_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

customer-profile:
  client_id: aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-zzzzzzzzzzzz
  client_secret: AAbbbCCCzzz==
  tenant_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

Here is an example for a GCP/GKE stack with user ADC and multiple GKE instances:

```yaml
---
gcp:
  general:
    mode: adc-user
    project: &gcp_project project-name
  gke:
    - name: kubernetes-1
      zone: europe-west1-c
    - name: kubernetes-2
      region: europe-west1

terraform:
  legacy: false # Use legacy version of the tool instead of OpenTofu, defaults to false. Only used if version >= 1.6.0.
  version: "1.0" # OpenTofu version that tfwrapper will use for this stack. Automatically downloaded if it's not available locally. Defaults to 1.0
  vars:
    gcp_region: europe-west1
    gcp_zone: europe-west1-c
    gcp_project: *gcp_project
    client_name: client-name
```

You can declare multiple providers configurations, context is set up accordingly.

âš  This feature is only supported for Azure stacks for now and only works with [Azure authentication isolation](#azure-authentication-isolation)

```yaml
---
azure:
  general:
    mode: service_principal # Uses an Azure tenant Service Principal account
    directory_id: &directory_id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Azure Tenant/Directory UID
    subscription_id: &subscription_id "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" # Azure Subscription UID

    credentials:
      profile: customer-profile # To stay coherent, create an AzureRM profile with the same name as the account-alias. Please checkout `azurerm_config.yml.sample` file for configuration structure.

  alternative:
    mode: service_principal # Uses an Azure tenant Service Principal account
    directory_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Azure Tenant/Directory UID
    subscription_id: "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222" # Azure Subscription UID

    credentials:
      profile: claranet-sandbox # To stay coherent, create an AzureRM profile with the same name as the account-alias. Please checkout `azurerm_config.yml.sample` file for configuration structure.

terraform:
  version: "1.0" # OpenTofu version that tfwrapper will use for this stack. Automatically downloaded if it's not available locally. Defaults to 1.0
  legacy: false # Use legacy version of the tool instead of OpenTofu, defaults to false. Only used if version >= 1.6.0.
  vars:
    subscription_id: *subscription_id
    directory_id: *directory_id
    client_name: client-name # Replace it with the name of your client
```

This configuration is useful when having various service principals with a dedicated rights scope for each.

The wrapper will generate the following Terraform variables that can be used in your stack:

- `<config_name>_azure_subscription_id` with Azure subscription ID. From the example, variable is: `alternative_subscription_id = "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"`
- `<config_name>_azure_tenant_id` with Azure tenant ID. From the example, variable is: `alternative_tenant_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`
- `<config_name>_azure_client_id` with Service Principal client id. From the example, variable is: `alternative_client_id = "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-zzzzzzzzzzzz"`
- `<config_name>_azure_client_secret` with Service Principal client secret. From the example, variable is: `alternative_client_secret = "AAbbbCCCzzz=="`

Also, an isolation context is set to the local `.run/aure_<config_name>` directory for each configuration.

### States centralization configuration

The `conf/state.yml` configuration file defines the configuration used to connect to state backends.

These backends can be of [AWS S3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) and/or [AzureRM](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm) types.

The resources for these backends are not created by tfwrapper, and thus must exist beforehand:
* AWS: an S3 bucket (and optionally but highly recommended a DynamoDB table for locking). It is also recommended to enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
* Azure: a Blob storage account

You can use other backends (e.g. Google GCS or Hashicorp Consul) not specifically supported by the wrapper, if you manage authentication yourself and omit the `conf/state.yml` file or make it empty:

```yaml
---
```

Example configuration with both AWS and Azure backends defined:

```yaml
---
aws:
  - name: "aws-demo"
    general:
      account: "xxxxxxxxxxx"
      region: eu-west-1
    credentials:
      profile: my-state-aws-profile # should be configured in .aws/config
azure:
  # This backend use storage keys for authentication
  - name: "azure-backend"
    general:
      subscription_id: "xxxxxxx" # the Azure account to use for state storage
      resource_group_name: "tfstates-xxxxx-rg" # The Azure resource group with state storage
      storage_account_name: "tfstatesxxxxx"
  - name: "azure-alternative"
    general:
      subscription_id: "xxxxxxx" # the Azure account to use for state storage
      resource_group_name: "tfstates-xxxxx-rg" # The Azure resource group with state storage
      storage_account_name: "tfstatesxxxxx"
  # This backend use Azure AD authentication
  - name: "azure-ad-auth"
    general:
      subscription_id: "xxxxxxx" # the Azure account to use for state storage
      resource_group_name: "tfstates-xxxxx-rg" # The Azure resource group with state storage
      storage_account_name: "tfstatesxxxxx"
      azuread_auth: true

backend_parameters: # Parameters or options which can be used by `state.j2.tf` template file
  state_snaphot: "false" # Example of Azure storage backend option
```

Note: the first backend will be the default one for stacks not defining `state_backend_type`.

### How to migrate from one backend to another for state centralization

If for example you have both an AWS and Azure state backend configured in your `conf/state.yml` file,
you can migrate your stack state from one backend to another.

Here is a quick howto:

1. Make sure your stack is clean:

```bash
$ cd account/path/env/your_stack
$ tfwrapper init
$ tfwrapper plan
# should return no changes
```

2. Change your backend in the stack configuration yaml file:

```yaml
---
#state_configuration_name: 'aws-demo' # previous backend
state_configuration_name: "azure-alternative" # new backend to use
```

3. Back in your stack directory, you can perform the change:

```bash
$ cd account/path/env/your_stack
$ rm -v state.tf # removing old state backend configuration
$ tfwrapper bootstrap # regen a new state backend configuration based on the stack yaml config file
$ tfwrapper init # Terraform will detect the new backend and propose to migrate it
$ tfwrapper plan
# should return the same changes diff as before
```

### SSH Tunnels configuration

`tfwrapper` can automatically open SSH tunnel to connect to a resource (Like database server) through a bastion.

In the stack configuration file :
```
tunnels:
  mysql:
    gateway_host: "bastion-host"
    gateway_port: 22
    gateway_login: tunnel-user
    gateway_private_key: ~/.ssh/keys/bastion-host.key
    remote_host: "mysqlf-server.mysql.database.azure.com"
    remote_port: 3306
    local_port: 3306
```

## Stacks file structure

Terraform stacks are organized based on their:

- `account`: an account alias which may refer to provider accounts or subscriptions, e.g. `project-a-prod`, `customer-b-dev`.
- `environment`: `production`, `preproduction`, `dev`, etc. With `global` as a special case eliminating the `region` part.
- `region`: `eu-west-1`, `westeurope`, etc.
- `stack`: defaults to `default`. `web`, `admin`, `tools`, etc.


The following file structure is then enforced:

```
# project root
â””â”€â”€ account
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ environment
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ region
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ stack
â””â”€â”€ account
    â””â”€â”€ _global
        â””â”€â”€ stack
```

A real-life example:

```
# project root
â”œâ”€â”€ aws-account-1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _global
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ production
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ eu-central-1
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web
â”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ eu-west-1
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ default
â”‚           â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.t
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ tools
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ main.tf
â””â”€â”€ aws-account-2
    â””â”€â”€ backup
        â””â”€â”€ eu-west-1
            â””â”€â”€ backup
                â””â”€â”€ main.tf
```

## Usage

### Stack bootstrap

After creating a `conf/${account}_${environment}_${region}_${stack}.yml` stack configuration file you can bootstrap it.

```bash
# you can bootstrap using the templates/{provider}/basic stack
tfwrapper -a ${account} -e ${environment} -r ${region} -s ${stack} bootstrap

# or another stack template, for example: templates/aws/foobar
tfwrapper -a ${account} -e ${environment} -r ${region} -s ${stack} bootstrap aws/foobar

# or from an existent stack, for example: customer/env/region/stack
tfwrapper -a ${account} -e ${environment} -r ${region} -s ${stack} bootstrap mycustomer/dev/eu-west/run
```

In the special case of a global stack, the configuration file should instead be named as `conf/${account}_global_${stack}.yml`.

### Working on stacks

You can work on stacks from their directory or from the root of the project.

```bash
# working from the root of the project
tfwrapper -a ${account} -e ${environment} -r ${region} -s ${stack} plan

# working from the root of a stack
cd ${account}/${environment}/${region}/${stack}
tfwrapper plan
```

You can also work on several stacks sequentially with the `foreach` subcommand from any directory under the root of the project.
By default, `foreach` selects all stacks under the current directory,
so if called from the root of the project without any filter,
it will select all stacks and execute the specified command in them, one after another:

```bash
# working from the root of the project
tfwrapper foreach -- tfwrapper init
```

Any combination of the `-a`, `-e`, `-r` and `-s` arguments can be used to select specific stacks,
e.g. all stacks for an account across all environments but in a specific region:

```bash
# working from the root of the project
tfwrapper -a ${account} -r ${region} foreach -- tfwrapper plan
```

The same can be achieved with:

```bash
# working from an account directory
cd ${account}
tfwrapper -r ${region} foreach -- tfwrapper plan
```

Complex commands can be executed in a sub-shell with the `-S`/`--shell` argument, e.g.:

```bash
# working from an environment directory
cd ${account}/${environment}
tfwrapper foreach -S 'pwd && tfwrapper init >/dev/null 2>&1 && tfwrapper plan 2>/dev/null -- -no-color | grep "^Plan: "'
```

### Passing options

You can pass anything you want to `terraform` using `--`.

```bash
tfwrapper plan -- -target resource1 -target resource2
```

## Environment

tfwrapper sets the following environment variables.

### S3 state backend credentials

The default AWS credentials of the environment are set to point to the S3 state backend. Those credentials are acquired from the profile defined in `conf/state.yml`

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`

### Azure Service Principal credentials

Those AzureRM credentials are loaded only if you are using the Service Principal mode. They are acquired from the profile defined in `~/.azurerm/config.yml`

- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ARM_TENANT_ID`

### Azure authentication isolation

`AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable is set to the local `.run/azure` directory if global configuration value `use_local_azure_session_directory` is set to `true`, which is the default, which is the default.

If you have multiple configurations in your stacks, you also have `<CONFIG_NAME>_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` which is set to the local `.run/azure_<config_name>` directory.

### GCP configuration

Those GCP related variables are available from the environment when using the example configuration:

- `TF_VAR_gcp_region`
- `TF_VAR_gcp_zone`
- `TF_VAR_gcp_project`

### GKE configurations

Each GKE instance has its own kubeconfig, the path to each configuration is available from the environment:

- `TF_VAR_gke_kubeconfig_${gke_cluster_name}`

kubeconfig is automatically fetched by the wrapper (using gcloud) and stored inside the `.run` directory of your project.
It is refreshed automatically at every run to ensure you point to correct Kubernetes endpoint.
You can disable this behaviour by setting `refresh_kubeconfig: never` in your cluster settings.

```yaml
---
gcp:
  general:
    mode: adc-user
    project: &gcp_project project-name
  gke:
    - name: kubernetes-1
      zone: europe-west1-c
      refresh_kubeconfig: never
```

### Stack configurations and credentials

The `terraform['vars']` dictionary from the stack configuration is accessible as Terraform variables.

The profile defined in the stack configuration is used to acquire credentials accessible from Terraform.
There is two supported providers, the variables which will be loaded depends on the used provider.

- `TF_VAR_client_name` (if set in .yml stack configuration file)

# Development

## Tests

All new code contributions should come with unit and/or integrations tests.

To run those tests locally, use [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox):

```bash
poetry run tox -e py
```

Linters are also used to ensure code respects our standards.

To run those linters locally:

```bash
poetry run tox -e lint
```

## Debug command-line completion

You can get verbose debugging information for `argcomplete` by defining the following environment variable:

```bash
export _ARC_DEBUG=1
```

## Python code formatting

Our code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black/).

Make sure to format all your code contributions with `black ${filename}`.

Hint: enable auto-format on save with `black` in your [favorite IDE](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html).

## Checks

To run code and documentation style checks, run `tox -e lint`.

In addition to `black --check`, code is also checked with:

- [flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8), a wrapper for [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) and [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes).
- [flake8-docstrings](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings), a wrapper for [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle).

## README TOC

This [README's table of content](#table-of-contents) is formatted with [md_toc](https://github.com/frnmst/md-toc).

Keep in mind to update it with `md_toc --in-place github README.md`.

## Using OpenTofu development builds

To build and use development versions of OpenTofu, put them in a `~/.terraform.d/versions/X.Y/X.Y.Z-dev/` folder:

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu.git ~/go/src/github.com/opentofu/opentofu
# cd ~/go/src/github.com/opentofu/opentofu
# go build ./cmd/tofu/
# ./tofu version
OpenTofu v1.6.0-dev
on linux_amd64
# mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/versions/1.6/1.6.0-dev
# mv ./opentofu ~/.terraform.d/versions/1.6/1.6.0-dev/
```

## git pre-commit hooks

Some git pre-commit hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for use with the [pre-commit tool](https://pre-commit.com).

Using them helps avoiding to push changes that will fail the CI.

They can be installed locally with:

```bash
# pre-commit install
```

If updating hooks configuration, run checks against all files to make sure everything is fine:

```bash
# pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
```

Note: the `pre-commit` tool itself can be installed with `pip` or `pipx`.

## Review and merge open Dependabot PRs

Use the `scripts/merge-dependabot-mrs.sh` script from `master` branch to:

- list open Dependabot PRs that are mergeable,
- review, approve and merge them,
- pull changes from github and pushing them to origin.

Just invoke the script without any argument:

```bash
# ./scripts/merge-dependabot-mrs.sh
```

Check the help:

```bash
# ./scripts/merge-dependabot-mrs.sh --help
```

## Tagging and publishing new releases to PyPI

Use the `scripts/release.sh` script from `master` branch to:

- bump the version with poetry,
- update `CHANGELOG.md`,
- commit these changes,
- tag with last CHANGELOG.md item content as annotation,
- bump the version with poetry again to mark it for development,
- commit this change,
- push all commits and tags to all remote repositories.

This will trigger a Github Actions job to publish packages to PyPI.

To invoke the script, pass it the desired bump rule, e.g.:

```bash
# ./scripts/release.sh minor
```

For more options, check the help:

```bash
# ./scripts/release.sh --help
```
